# Slopsmith Remote Library Client

Remote Library Client connects Slopsmith to one or more direct Remote Library Server URLs. Each configured server is registered as a Slopsmith library provider, so it appears in the core Library source selector.

## Runtime Model

The plugin declares the core `library` capability as a provider. Its manifest uses provider `operations` (`query-page`, `query-artists`, `query-stats`, `tuning-names`, `get-art`, `sync-song`) because configured Remote Library Server URLs are exposed through Slopsmith's native library provider coordinator. Connection management stays on the plugin's existing screen and backend routes; those UI actions are not declared as a separate capability domain.

## Usage

1. Install the Remote Library Server plugin on the machine that owns the library.
2. Start that server on its own port.
3. Install this client plugin on the browsing machine.
4. Open **Remote Client** and add the server base URL, such as `studio.local`, `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, or `http://192.168.1.X:8765`. If you omit the protocol or port, the client tries `http` and then `https` on port `8765`.
5. Open the main Library screen and choose the remote source from the source selector.
6. Optional: enable **NAM tones** for the source to sync mapped NAM presets, `.nam` models, and IR `.wav` files when songs are downloaded.
7. Click a remote song to load it into the local library cache and play it.

NAM tone sync is best-effort and non-fatal. If the remote server does not share tone assets, or a tone asset fails to download, the song package still syncs normally and the sync result includes a `toneSync` status object.
